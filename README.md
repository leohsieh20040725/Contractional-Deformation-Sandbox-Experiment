The "Contractional-Deformation-Sandbox-Experiment" script in this repository is designed to plot the dip angles of major faults (A through G) against slide numbers from an experimental sequence. The script reads predefined dip values and slide numbers, then generates a comprehensive plot showing the evolution of fault dips as the experiment progresses. The plot includes labeled axes, a legend for fault identification, and grid lines for enhanced visualization. This visualization aids in understanding the deformation dynamics and comparing the behavior of different faults throughout the experiment.
